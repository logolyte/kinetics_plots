A Python module called kinetics_plots for chemical kinetics plots. Contains a Reaction class used for storing chemical reactions and a plot_reactions function for plotting how a system of chemical reactions affects the concentrations of compounds over time. Three demonstration programs are also included: lotka_voltera.py, belousov_zhabotinsky.py and lotka_voltera.py. These are runnable Python scripts that use the kinetics_plots module to plot oscillating chemical reactions. The plots produced by bray_liebhafsky.py are also included.

Dependencies: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot
